### Problem being solved

What specific problem, gap, or risk does this change address?
Describe the observable symptom or unmet need — not the solution.

### Why now?

What triggered this work at this moment?
(e.g., issue report, production incident, performance data, security finding, product decision, accumulating tech debt)

### Cost of not doing this

What would happen if this change were never made?
State the concrete consequence: degraded UX, security exposure, blocked roadmap, accruing maintenance burden, etc.

### Why this approach over alternatives?

List at least one alternative that was considered and explain why it was ruled out.
If there was no real alternative, explain why the solution space is constrained.
